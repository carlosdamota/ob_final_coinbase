## Acknowledgments

Special mention to Angela Garcia [@Angela-GM] (https://github.com/Angela-GM), my wife, with whom I try to compete every day to improve. I would also like to thank [@openbootcamp] (https://open-bootcamp.com/) for their daily effort to bring "free" content to the platform and try to improve the community.

* I would also like to add that Open-bootcamp is an incredible and free platform with a great community. However, currently, due to the bubble in the industry, they have opened a donation line through GitHub. It would be a shame for this platform that can be so helpful to disappear, so if you want to support it, please consider making a donation (https://github.com/sponsors/Open-Bootcamp)
